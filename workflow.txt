CURRENT WORKFLOW:
=================

1. USER AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
   • User visits /auth/login
   • Enters email/password with validation
   • Form submits with loading state
   • Success notification shown
   • Redirects to dashboard (simulated)

2. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FLOW:
   • User navigates to /inventory/items
   • Views paginated list of inventory items
   • Can search/filter items manually
   • Clicks QR scanner button in search bar
   • QRScanner1 modal opens with camera
   • User scans QR code or uses test button
   • Success sound plays with visual feedback
   • Scanned value automatically searches inventory
   • If item found: Shows success notification with item details
   • If no match: Shows alert with scanned value
   • Search term updates automatically based on scan result

3. QR SCANNING FLOW:
   • Modal opens with loading state
   • Camera initializes automatically
   • User points camera at QR code
   • Scanner detects QR code automatically
   • Success overlay appears with sound
   • Value sent to parent component
   • Modal closes after 2 seconds
   • Parent component processes scanned value

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS:
==========================

• State Management: React useState hooks throughout
• Component Communication: Props drilling for QR scanner
• Error Handling: Try-catch blocks and user-friendly messages
• TypeScript: Strict typing for all components and data
• Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach
• Performance: Next.js Image optimization, proper component lifecycle
• Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML
